```
Our firm decision is to work from this focused center: One man died for everyone. That puts everyone in the same boat. He included everyone in his death so that everyone could also be included in his life, a resurrection life, a far better life than people ever lived on their own.

16-20 Because of this decision we don’t evaluate people by what they have or how they look. We looked at the Messiah that way once and got it all wrong, as you know. We certainly don’t look at him that way anymore. Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with the Messiah gets a fresh start, is created new. The old life is gone; a new life burgeons! Look at it! All this comes from the God who settled the relationship between us and him, and then called us to settle our relationships with each other. God put the world square with himself through the Messiah, giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. God has given us the task of telling everyone what he is doing. We’re Christ’s representatives. God uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into God’s work of making things right between them. We’re speaking for Christ himself now: Become friends with God; he’s already a friend with you.

21 How? you ask. In Christ. God put the wrong on him who never did anything wrong, so we could be put right with God.

## What does the passage say?
Paul begins by saying that as along as we breath and walk this earth, the one thing we should know deep in our core is that one man died for everyone. He died for us so we could join him in heaven, and live a far better life one that our brains cannot even imagine.

And it is precisely the reason why we do not judge, analyze or evaluate people from the outside, we made that mistake once crucifying the most pure Human. Instead, we should aim at looking at people from the inside. When we take time to look inside, we see that anyone united with God has a fresh start, they are reborn. When Jesus died for everyone, God was putting the world square with Him giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. With this gift and knowledge come responsibility. God at the center, our lives are an embodiment of Christ capable of shining light for people helping them move in the direction of God. We too can be shepherd leading sheep to the right pastures.

## What did the passage mean to the original readers?
The first part of the passage could have caused some confusion - most of these passages cause confusion at first for original readers/listeners. One man died for everyone? He died for our sins? He gave us a second chance? We should live our lives knowing that one man died for everyone? What does this all mean?

Once original readers/listeners continue reading/listening some I image would being to remember how people treated Jesus unjustly all because he was going against their worldly understanding. Those that remember begin to knowledge that they reacted this way towards Jesus because they judged and evaluated him from the outside. That was clearly a mistake. He gave them a second chance, giving the world a fresh start by forgiving their sins. So instead of looking and focusing on the outside, they should focus on looking inside. Looking inside they will find that God has been waiting to befriend them.

## What does the passage mean to me today?
The passage shows that the world we live in today was created by God, and designed by man. Empires have rose and fell, we’ve built bridges, soaring buildings, we’ve designed a world to make our stay on earth easier and comfortable. For security we created societies with rules and laws to govern us, protect our liberties etc. Today everything is about status and prestige, to sum it up, the world now rewards those with the most valued items (excellent job, great car, great house, hot wife, great school etc.). We’re slowly drifting away from measuring people from the inside. Look at the candidates campaigning to represent United States, look at the widening gap of income distribution, look at the distrust of the police in black neighborhoods etc. History does repeat itself...we are making the same mistakes we made many years back, crucifying Jesus.

I am a firm believer that God lives in each and everyone of us. Jesus died for us so he can cleanse our sins. He gave us a second chance. He gave us the ultimate gift that one day we will rejoice with him. It doesn’t matter whether you’re rich or poor, we are all equal in the eye of God. So for me, I don’t know what my purpose is or what God has planned for me, but I know that we are all blessed with such a precious gift inside of us that it is our responsibility to be light in other people’s lives. I should aim at looking at people from the inside and help them move in the right direction. The right direction depends on the situation at hand - God will be working through me.
