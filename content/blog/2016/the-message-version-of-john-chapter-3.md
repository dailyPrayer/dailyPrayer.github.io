## What does it say?
God genuinely cares and loves us that he was willing to bring from Heaven his only beloved Son to tell us that 
there is eternal life. That anyone who believes in the Son, believes in God and therefore understand deeply 
they will live forever. However, those that doubt in the Son have actually been doomed long before they’ve got 
to this point. 

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came from Heaven to walk among us doing miracle after miracle to show people how 
to live and how to welcome God into their lives. Instead of walking towards the light, many turn the opposite 
way fearing to expose their sins and shortcomings. Those that are willing to accept their sins, and shortcomings 
gravitated towards God.

## What did it mean to the people who heard it then?
First off, this was uncommon. A child is so precious to a family that it does not even cross their minds to 
give the child away. Especially in uncertain environments. Eternal life. 

## What did that mean to people back then? 
I’m sure many believed in various gods and they had hierarchical class systems that favored the masters. 
What kept the poor going? Who did they lean on before Jesus walked the earth? It must have been painful 
listening to the words of wisdom resonating with people that it must have required a certain level of courage 
and belief. Belief that there is truly nothing to be afraid of. Courage for being the outliers even though all 
around their neighbor, friends and family members turned their back. 

## Prayer:
Dear God, each day I am blessed to be alive. Many years ago you brought your only beloved Son from Heaven to 
walk among us, to show us the way, to show us your true image and the miracles. I believe deep down that you 
never left this earth. I believe you stayed with us all these years and still walk among us each day. You fill 
many people’s hearts with joy - those that recognize and accept your true love and grace. I pray you walk alongside me, 
my girlfriend, Mom, Emma and Daniel. Be our guide. In Jesus’s name we pray, Amen.
