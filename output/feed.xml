      <title>Paul&apos;s Chains Advance the Gospel</title>

      	<description>
	&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12 Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,[a] that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. 13 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard[b] and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 14 And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.

15 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 16 The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 17 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 18 But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.[c] 20 I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.22 If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 23 I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 24 but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,[d] striving together as one for the faith of the gospel 28 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. 29 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, 30 since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the passage say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul’s presence in chains from an outsider’s perspective is surely an uncomfortable situation, one that no one would desire to be in because Paul is striped from his freedom bounded by chains. But Paul assures onlookers that there is a higher purpose than what meets the eye. Stating that he might look hopeless in chains, but a grander lesson is being taught. He knowledges to onlookers that because of his chains, men and women who previously were afraid to proclaim the gospel are now emboldened to rejoice and speak of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people preach Christ because they would like to possess his power and wisdom, others preach Christ because they think they are the true Christ and therefore consider him as a rival, but others preach Christ out of goodwill. Unbounded love is what guides those that preach Christ out of goodwill. The others have selfish ambitions and motives, but Paul does not care because Christ is preached and for that there is cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is torn between two desires: depart and be in the heavenly kingdom with Christ, which is far better; or remain in the body and advance progress and joy in faith. Paul deep down fundamentally understands his purpose in faith. A life worthy of the Gospel is to live in Christ – “For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did the passage mean to the original readers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I gather in the passage, Paul was talking directly to onlookers gathered around him curiously trying to make sense of the situation. While he spoke to onlookers, there must have been three groups of people listening to what he said, and because of this, they may have interpreted what he said differently. In the passage, Paul points out some people envy Christ, others think Christ is overrated, and others see the shining beauty in Christ. So as you can image, Paul in chains saying that don’t look at my chains, look at the bigger picture, what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. The onlooker who thought Christ was overrated and those that envied Christ must have thought Paul was confused. The onlookers who see Christ became even more confident in the Lord. In confidence, they know that standing firmly in one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without wavering signals those that oppose them will be destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the passage mean to me today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose this passage at this point in time because it resonates to one of my internal conflicts I am grappling with which is my reluctance to be confident in the Lord. This by no means imply that I don’t trust or believe in the Lord, quite the contrary; what mean by those words is for example, if I was to walk up to a crowd and had to proclaim the gospel I would not have the confidence. In essence, I would be in fear. I am a very private person by nature so in a way I am reserved and believe my relationship with God is mine and none of other people’s business. That could be the case. But that doesn’t explain the fear. Rejoice. In the midst of my internal conflicts, I know deep down that because I am having these conversations with Christ in prayer there is room to rejoice! And rejoice I will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2 Corinthians 5:14-21</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/2-Corinthians-5-14-21.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Our firm decision is to work from this focused center: One man died for everyone. That puts everyone in the same boat. He included everyone in his death so that everyone could also be included in his life, a resurrection life, a far better life than people ever lived on their own.

16-20 Because of this decision we don’t evaluate people by what they have or how they look. We looked at the Messiah that way once and got it all wrong, as you know. We certainly don’t look at him that way anymore. Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with the Messiah gets a fresh start, is created new. The old life is gone; a new life burgeons! Look at it! All this comes from the God who settled the relationship between us and him, and then called us to settle our relationships with each other. God put the world square with himself through the Messiah, giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. God has given us the task of telling everyone what he is doing. We’re Christ’s representatives. God uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into God’s work of making things right between them. We’re speaking for Christ himself now: Become friends with God; he’s already a friend with you.

21 How? you ask. In Christ. God put the wrong on him who never did anything wrong, so we could be put right with God.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the passage say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul begins by saying that as along as we breath and walk this earth, the one thing we should know deep in our core is that one man died for everyone. He died for us so we could join him in heaven, and live a far better life one that our brains cannot even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is precisely the reason why we do not judge, analyze or evaluate people from the outside, we made that mistake once crucifying the most pure Human. Instead, we should aim at looking at people from the inside. When we take time to look inside, we see that anyone united with God has a fresh start, they are reborn. When Jesus died for everyone, God was putting the world square with Him giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. With this gift and knowledge come responsibility. God at the center, our lives are an embodiment of Christ capable of shining light for people helping them move in the direction of God. We too can be shepherd leading sheep to the right pastures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did the passage mean to the original readers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the passage could have caused some confusion - most of these passages cause confusion at first for original readers/listeners. One man died for everyone? He died for our sins? He gave us a second chance? We should live our lives knowing that one man died for everyone? What does this all mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once original readers/listeners continue reading/listening some I image would being to remember how people treated Jesus unjustly all because he was going against their worldly understanding. Those that remember begin to knowledge that they reacted this way towards Jesus because they judged and evaluated him from the outside. That was clearly a mistake. He gave them a second chance, giving the world a fresh start by forgiving their sins. So instead of looking and focusing on the outside, they should focus on looking inside. Looking inside they will find that God has been waiting to befriend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the passage mean to me today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage shows that the world we live in today was created by God, and designed by man. Empires have rose and fell, we’ve built bridges, soaring buildings, we’ve designed a world to make our stay on earth easier and comfortable. For security we created societies with rules and laws to govern us, protect our liberties etc. Today everything is about status and prestige, to sum it up, the world now rewards those with the most valued items (excellent job, great car, great house, hot wife, great school etc.). We’re slowly drifting away from measuring people from the inside. Look at the candidates campaigning to represent United States, look at the widening gap of income distribution, look at the distrust of the police in black neighborhoods etc. History does repeat itself...we are making the same mistakes we made many years back, crucifying Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer that God lives in each and everyone of us. Jesus died for us so he can cleanse our sins. He gave us a second chance. He gave us the ultimate gift that one day we will rejoice with him. It doesn’t matter whether you’re rich or poor, we are all equal in the eye of God. So for me, I don’t know what my purpose is or what God has planned for me, but I know that we are all blessed with such a precious gift inside of us that it is our responsibility to be light in other people’s lives. I should aim at looking at people from the inside and help them move in the right direction. The right direction depends on the situation at hand - God will be working through me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John 3 - John the Baptist</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/Galatians-2-7-21.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2016/Galatians-2-7-21.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;17 “But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! 18 If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.&amp;quot;

19 “For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the passage say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was talking to Christ-followers acknowledging that they have all followed Christ closely, tried to emulate Christ’s wisdom, but with all these measures they’re still not perfect. As Christ-followers, by now they think their sins would be cleansed and a step closer to God. Christ-followers trying to justify what was happening they thought - Christ must be closely tied with sin? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Christ-followers transcend their understanding of God, Paul gave them his personal accounts on how he broke free of institutional chains to be closer to God. He explains to them that he stopped keeping rules, and keeping count of all the good deeds he made all in order to please God. Instead he put he put his ego aside and made God his center. He no longer tired to impress Him. He didn’t care much for other people’s opinion because he is living God’s life, not his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ-followers are missing the mark when they believe they have to live/practice “old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion”. It is about the relationship with God and that comes from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did it mean to the people who were hearing it at the time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a generalization but I think we humans all have egos that vary in size, some bigger than others. And most of us fail to recognize that we have one at all. On one side of the coin, some Christ-followers listening to Paul’s letter could have acknowledged that they had their ego front and center. Keeping a mental scoreboard every time they did good, looking over their shoulder to see what their peers were doing, how much closer to God they were etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, some Christ-followers listening to Paul’s letter could have had a hard time justifying what Paul wrote. Thinking that by them following rules closely, working hard to please God was the relationship they had with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean for me today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage resonates with many people in today’s society for many obvious reasons. For me it means freedom, content, and listening to the self and understanding the self. Keeping the old rules and peer-pleasing norms today such as must have a good looking girlfriend, beautiful car, great job, etc.. is the wrong way of thinking. Its out dated and egocentric. The old way of thinking creates anxiety in social interactions, resentment of other’s accomplishments because you constantly measure yourself to other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to break free of the old way of thinking. I want to listen to myself because by doing so I am listening to Him. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John 3 - John the Baptist</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/John3-John-the-Baptist.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;h2&gt;What does it say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son-of-God was brought down to earth as a gift from God. The Son was placed on earth to witness, live our experiences, and speak our language. God was on a different level of which we cannot relate, but He walking among us understood the world God lived in - so He acted and spoke in a way that exposed God’s world. These facts were not easy to digest to people, but those that understood unwavering and wholeheartedly believed God was the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God loves His Son so much that He gave His Son the keys (representing full access). The Son carried with him keys to the Kingdom. He walked the earth with the entire being of the Holy Spirit that whoever accepted and wholeheartedly trusted Him automatically was granted the VIP pass to the Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did it mean to the people who heard it then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist explaining these things to people must have been an interesting interaction. In this particular interaction, those that were lucky to have been in the presence of Jesus in the past must have somehow made the connection to what John was saying. Made the connection that the Son-of-God did speak their language but that what often came out of His mouth was of deep wisdom. They also saw that He lived their experiences but often took the unconventional path in coming to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean to me today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist validates what it means to be Born Again. The words John the Baptist said back then show that it is not enough to simply walk the earth passively. It takes your whole being to place trust in God, and to do that you need to allow God into your heart because you wholeheartedly believe God is the truth. Only then will you have keys to the Kingdom. Today it means actively praying for God&apos;s grace and forgiveness. Actively inviting God into my life because He wants to be part of my life. He wants me to have keys to the Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John chapter 9, verse 35 - 41</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/john-9-spiritual-blindness.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

      	<description>
	&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
36 “Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.”
37 Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”
38 Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
39 Jesus said,[a] “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”
40 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?”
41 Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus heard that the blindman he had performed a miracle on has been investigated by pharisees. The blindman’s allegations to&lt;br/&gt;the pharisees that a prophet named Jesus made him see were dismissed leading to the blindman to be thrown out. Jesus approached&lt;br/&gt;the man, asked him whether he believed in the Son of Man. Because the man was blind(spiritually) Jesus affirmed the man that He&lt;br/&gt;was the Son of Man. From that simple interaction, the man now believed that Jesus was the Lord. Jesus walks the earth so that the&lt;br/&gt;blind can see and those that can see turn blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did it mean to the people who heard it then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that very moment when the pharisees investigated the blindman, and were told that a prophet named Jesus was behind the miracle,&lt;br/&gt;they were instantly exposed to light(spiritually). By rejecting claims made by blindman they became blind. It was interesting towards&lt;br/&gt;the end of the verses on verse 40 - pharisees were surprised over hearing Jesus’s comments that they too were blind like everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;It is hard to say what it meant to those pharisees because since first chapter of John until this point, there has been a disconnect between&lt;br/&gt;the physical world and the spiritual world when Jesus communicates to people in those times and there comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean to me today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even through the blindman was healed from his blindness, if the man couldn’t knowledge that God’s grace facilitated the miracle, the&lt;br/&gt;man would still be blind like the pharisees. That’s a powerful statement which resonated then, and even much so today in my life. We&lt;br/&gt;are sometimes quick to point out the negatives in our lives, for example the usual suspects like how our politics is corrupt that’s why I&lt;br/&gt;pay too much taxes, I cannot find a job or I hate my job now etc... On the other hand, when things are going great in our minds “supposed&lt;br/&gt;to be that way” “I’m supposed to be where I am” etc..., there’s little to no recognition that God’s grace facilitated our journey to a particular&lt;br/&gt;point. It is important to lean on God in moments of celebrations and in tough times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Message Version of John Chapter 3</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/the-message-version-of-john-chapter-3.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;h2&gt;What does it say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God genuinely cares and loves us that he was willing to bring from Heaven his only beloved Son to tell us that&lt;br/&gt;there is eternal life. That anyone who believes in the Son, believes in God and therefore understand deeply&lt;br/&gt;they will live forever. However, those that doubt in the Son have actually been doomed long before they’ve got&lt;br/&gt;to this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came from Heaven to walk among us doing miracle after miracle to show people how&lt;br/&gt;to live and how to welcome God into their lives. Instead of walking towards the light, many turn the opposite&lt;br/&gt;way fearing to expose their sins and shortcomings. Those that are willing to accept their sins, and shortcomings&lt;br/&gt;gravitated towards God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did it mean to the people who heard it then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, this was uncommon. A child is so precious to a family that it does not even cross their minds to&lt;br/&gt;give the child away. Especially in uncertain environments. Eternal life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did that mean to people back then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure many believed in various gods and they had hierarchical class systems that favored the masters.&lt;br/&gt;What kept the poor going? Who did they lean on before Jesus walked the earth? It must have been painful&lt;br/&gt;listening to the words of wisdom resonating with people that it must have required a certain level of courage&lt;br/&gt;and belief. Belief that there is truly nothing to be afraid of. Courage for being the outliers even though all&lt;br/&gt;around their neighbor, friends and family members turned their back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prayer:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear God, each day I am blessed to be alive. Many years ago you brought your only beloved Son from Heaven to&lt;br/&gt;walk among us, to show us the way, to show us your true image and the miracles. I believe deep down that you&lt;br/&gt;never left this earth. I believe you stayed with us all these years and still walk among us each day. You fill&lt;br/&gt;many people’s hearts with joy - those that recognize and accept your true love and grace. I pray you walk alongside me,&lt;br/&gt;my girlfriend, Mom, Emma and Daniel. Be our guide. In Jesus’s name we pray, Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
