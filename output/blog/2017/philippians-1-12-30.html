		<h1>Paul&apos;s Chains Advance the Gospel</h1>

	<p><em>12 January 2017</em></p>

	<p><pre><code>12 Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,[a] that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. 13 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard[b] and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 14 And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.

15 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 16 The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 17 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 18 But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.[c] 20 I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.22 If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 23 I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 24 but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,[d] striving together as one for the faith of the gospel 28 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. 29 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, 30 since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

<h2>What does the passage say?</h2>
<p>Paul’s presence in chains from an outsider’s perspective is surely an uncomfortable situation, one that no one would desire to be in because Paul is striped from his freedom bounded by chains. But Paul assures onlookers that there is a higher purpose than what meets the eye. Stating that he might look hopeless in chains, but a grander lesson is being taught. He knowledges to onlookers that because of his chains, men and women who previously were afraid to proclaim the gospel are now emboldened to rejoice and speak of the Lord.</p>
<p>Some people preach Christ because they would like to possess his power and wisdom, others preach Christ because they think they are the true Christ and therefore consider him as a rival, but others preach Christ out of goodwill. Unbounded love is what guides those that preach Christ out of goodwill. The others have selfish ambitions and motives, but Paul does not care because Christ is preached and for that there is cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Paul is torn between two desires: depart and be in the heavenly kingdom with Christ, which is far better; or remain in the body and advance progress and joy in faith. Paul deep down fundamentally understands his purpose in faith. A life worthy of the Gospel is to live in Christ – “For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him”.</p>
<h2>What did the passage mean to the original readers?</h2>
<p>From what I gather in the passage, Paul was talking directly to onlookers gathered around him curiously trying to make sense of the situation. While he spoke to onlookers, there must have been three groups of people listening to what he said, and because of this, they may have interpreted what he said differently. In the passage, Paul points out some people envy Christ, others think Christ is overrated, and others see the shining beauty in Christ. So as you can image, Paul in chains saying that don’t look at my chains, look at the bigger picture, what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. The onlooker who thought Christ was overrated and those that envied Christ must have thought Paul was confused. The onlookers who see Christ became even more confident in the Lord. In confidence, they know that standing firmly in one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without wavering signals those that oppose them will be destroyed. </p>
<h2>What does the passage mean to me today?</h2>
<p>I choose this passage at this point in time because it resonates to one of my internal conflicts I am grappling with which is my reluctance to be confident in the Lord. This by no means imply that I don’t trust or believe in the Lord, quite the contrary; what mean by those words is for example, if I was to walk up to a crowd and had to proclaim the gospel I would not have the confidence. In essence, I would be in fear. I am a very private person by nature so in a way I am reserved and believe my relationship with God is mine and none of other people’s business. That could be the case. But that doesn’t explain the fear. Rejoice. In the midst of my internal conflicts, I know deep down that because I am having these conversations with Christ in prayer there is room to rejoice! And rejoice I will.</p></p>
