		<h1>The Message Version of John Chapter 3</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>08 September 2016</em></p>

	<p><h2>What does it say?</h2>
<p>God genuinely cares and loves us that he was willing to bring from Heaven his only beloved Son to tell us that<br/>there is eternal life. That anyone who believes in the Son, believes in God and therefore understand deeply<br/>they will live forever. However, those that doubt in the Son have actually been doomed long before they’ve got<br/>to this point. </p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came from Heaven to walk among us doing miracle after miracle to show people how<br/>to live and how to welcome God into their lives. Instead of walking towards the light, many turn the opposite<br/>way fearing to expose their sins and shortcomings. Those that are willing to accept their sins, and shortcomings<br/>gravitated towards God.</p>
<h2>What did it mean to the people who heard it then?</h2>
<p>First off, this was uncommon. A child is so precious to a family that it does not even cross their minds to<br/>give the child away. Especially in uncertain environments. Eternal life. </p>
<h2>What did that mean to people back then?</h2>
<p>I’m sure many believed in various gods and they had hierarchical class systems that favored the masters.<br/>What kept the poor going? Who did they lean on before Jesus walked the earth? It must have been painful<br/>listening to the words of wisdom resonating with people that it must have required a certain level of courage<br/>and belief. Belief that there is truly nothing to be afraid of. Courage for being the outliers even though all<br/>around their neighbor, friends and family members turned their back. </p>
<h2>Prayer:</h2>
<p>Dear God, each day I am blessed to be alive. Many years ago you brought your only beloved Son from Heaven to<br/>walk among us, to show us the way, to show us your true image and the miracles. I believe deep down that you<br/>never left this earth. I believe you stayed with us all these years and still walk among us each day. You fill<br/>many people’s hearts with joy - those that recognize and accept your true love and grace. I pray you walk alongside me,<br/>my girlfriend, Mom, Emma and Daniel. Be our guide. In Jesus’s name we pray, Amen.</p></p>
