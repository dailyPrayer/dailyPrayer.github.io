		<h1>John 3 - John the Baptist</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>13 October 2016</em></p>

	<p><h2>What does it say?</h2>
<p>The Son-of-God was brought down to earth as a gift from God. The Son was placed on earth to witness, live our experiences, and speak our language. God was on a different level of which we cannot relate, but He walking among us understood the world God lived in - so He acted and spoke in a way that exposed Godâ€™s world. These facts were not easy to digest to people, but those that understood unwavering and wholeheartedly believed God was the truth.</p>
<p>God loves His Son so much that He gave His Son the keys (representing full access). The Son carried with him keys to the Kingdom. He walked the earth with the entire being of the Holy Spirit that whoever accepted and wholeheartedly trusted Him automatically was granted the VIP pass to the Kingdom. </p>
<h2>What did it mean to the people who heard it then?</h2>
<p>John the Baptist explaining these things to people must have been an interesting interaction. In this particular interaction, those that were lucky to have been in the presence of Jesus in the past must have somehow made the connection to what John was saying. Made the connection that the Son-of-God did speak their language but that what often came out of His mouth was of deep wisdom. They also saw that He lived their experiences but often took the unconventional path in coming to solutions.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to me today?</h2>
<p>John the Baptist validates what it means to be Born Again. The words John the Baptist said back then show that it is not enough to simply walk the earth passively. It takes your whole being to place trust in God, and to do that you need to allow God into your heart because you wholeheartedly believe God is the truth. Only then will you have keys to the Kingdom. Today it means actively praying for God's grace and forgiveness. Actively inviting God into my life because He wants to be part of my life. He wants me to have keys to the Kingdom. </p></p>
